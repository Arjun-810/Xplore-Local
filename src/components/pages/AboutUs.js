            <p className="about-content-parah">We took our first steps in Varanasi, India, in June 2015 and are now extending to other destinations. Our Delhi chapter was launched in February 2018, Lucknow, Amritsar, Agra and Allahabad in 2019. The Himalayas and Dehradun chapters are in the pipeline. We have conducted 1,600+ Heritage Walks and have made to the memories of over 5,000 travellers from 45+ nationalities. We have received the Trip Advisorâ€™s Certificate of Excellence for 2 consecutive years and have gained more than 550 valuable reviews, mostly 5 stars (95% of them!). The second version of our Mobile App is under testing with the travellers in Varanasi from June 2018 and has shown encouraging results. In time, we plan to cover all of India and other countries to continue leaving the trails with memorable experiences ðŸ™‚</p>
